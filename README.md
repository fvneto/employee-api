# employee-api
Simple CRUD using a RESTfull application, where we knowingly call backend. The other part, frontend has not yet been implemented, but soon I hope to start it and make it available. In short, the backend is responsible for providing a web service that can be called through a URL and responding to what was requested in JSON.
